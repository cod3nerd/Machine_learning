    "# Pearson Correlation Coefficient Calculation demystified\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous post, we have discussed the importance of understanding the correlation coefficient and how to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson coefficient gives the idea of how strongly the variables have a linear relationship with the target variable. Once, these values are determined between each of the dependent variables and the target value it can be decided which are the independent features to be considered while building a linear model (be it regression or classifier model). The features which have a higher value (>0.7) can be considered for building the model while dropping the ones below that. The above step of selecting the features based on correlation falls under the feature selection step. Better the features better the output/accuracy of the model being built."
